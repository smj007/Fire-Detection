# Fire-Detection
Few Implementations of the detector
 Completed :
 - InceptionV3 Implementation
 - Custom CNN Implementation
 - Real time detection using OpenCV (screenshot of trial not included due to pyrophobia)
 
 Optimizations : 
 - To incorporate smoke detectors (within the same implementation)
 - To make the ROI around the fire pop-up above the captured frame
